SYNCHRONOUS:-
**************
->Means not happening at the same time.

Synchronous programming is a blocking architecture where each operation depends on the one before it

ASYNCHRONOUS:-
***************
->Means happening at the same time.

Asynchronous programming is a non-blocking architecture where tasks can run simultaneously

What is A CAllback function?
****************************
->Any function that is passed as an argument to another function 
so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback.


What is A CAll Stack?
---------------------
Call Stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store 
and manage function invocation call at run-time.


callStack.js

       |   CallStack        |
       |   ----------       |
       |console.log('john') |
       |Anonymous ('john')  |
       |console.log('mani') |
       |Anonymous ('mani')  |
       |forEach()           |
       |listeUsers()        |
       |Main()              |
       ----------------------

Node.js has only one stack but with the help of call back Queue 
and Event loops they execute codes asynchronously.

What is A Callback Queue:-
*****************

->maintains a list of callback function that are ready to get executed

index.js

What is A Event loops:
*************

->ensures the execution of the callback after the call stack get empty

What is A Promise
******************

PENDING : FULFILLED : REJECT

promise.js
